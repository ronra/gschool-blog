#A recap of your work pattern (days, hours, working alone / with others)
4 days; avg. amount of hours: 8 to 9 hours; 75% worked alone/ only worked with others when I had questions.

#Summary of your results/conclusions
Failed results because of a wrong strategy.

#What worked and you’ll do the same next time
Asking questions early.

#What didn’t work and you’ll change next time
The hours of working alone. Next time will look to join a group to work on future projects.
