#SalesEngine

#What was the most surprising thing about your work on the project?

The amount of time I spent with working in a pair. We would meet early morning starting at 8:15am; go thru our breaks talking to each other; and leave Galvanize after midnight talking to each other about how we

#How many hours did you put in?

This project, I was on google more than I ever been. In regards to the hours I put in..can't give an exact number, but can give you a breakdown: 
First week of SalesEngine: Tuesday thru Sunday: avg of 16 to 17 hrs./day
Second week of SalesEngine: Monday thru Wednesday: avg. of 17 to 18 hrs./day

#How many of them were valuable? 

See below...

#Could the valuable ones exist without the invaluable? 

Huh? Sorry I am answering these question starting from the bottom...

#How will you replicate or change your schedule for the next project?

I would replicate my schedule for the next project as I did for this past one. We were able to set a time on each other. We both felt we needed sleep to be productive for the next day(unfortunately, warmup exercises did help being the first thing to do when you wake up).

#If you were going to start the project again on Tuesday, what would you do differently?

We were able to come up with a great gameplan on how to tackle this project, but we tried to incorporate our brainstorming ideas onto pivitol tracker(which took a day away from us).Pivitol Tracker would be great usage for a group of more than two developers. 

Focusing on the pair work process, what did your pair do well? 
My fellow developer has a key skill that will make him a good developer: patience...we would work around the clock trying to figure how approach each section of the project...we were able to find solution thru patience with our failed attempts...

#What did you struggle with?

What’s something that worked but you have no idea how/why?
Big"Bad"Decimal....he's pretty tricky! Went to at least a dozen people and all had a different way of you using it.  At the end, I plugged it in where I felt it was needed...and like magic...it suprised me it worked...


#Becoming a Developer

#You’ve finished your first real project. NOW are you a developer? Why/why not?

Not Yet...because its only been 4 weeks...and one week was getting to know each other...
so...more like 3 weeks...


#What’s your favorite thing about our class (people and/or structures)?

This program has a group of future developers that are willing to give up their free time to help those who may need extra help understanding the projects. After getting to know them after a month, they are genuinely "good people".
