#Was there a tip that rung true with your past experience in a field other than programming? How was it similar? "Learn to fish"

In order for real learning to happen you must have a eager teacher and a willing student. I've had educators in the past who gave me a book and told me to read chapter X and complete the assignment, without ever taking the time to teach.  In some ways that made me a better student because I did not think anyone could be a better teacher than myself. However, I have learned that if I ask the right questions and become a proactive learner I can enhance my educational experience for the better.
