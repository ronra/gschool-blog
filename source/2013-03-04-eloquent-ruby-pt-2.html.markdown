#Does the idea of Metaprogramming make you say "Hell yeah!" or "Hell no!"? Why?

It depends...metaprogramming has its pros and cons...I mean if you're good at programming, then I would recommend its a risk you should take. Create a program that will program more programming(sounded better when I thought it)...Let me give an example: mother wants to go out, but she needs to use a teenager as a babysitter...now this teenager is an instragram groupie...mother sees this and comes up with the idea on creating a copy of herself that would watch her baby while she can go out and relax...now that was pro...a con would be the babysitter cloning herself to babysit..then we will have a serious problem....

Point, if you're a good programmer, then start metaprogramming and master it...if you're newbie...stay away and be patient...
