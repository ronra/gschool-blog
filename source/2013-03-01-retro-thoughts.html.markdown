#MY PROGRESS

#We’re officially one month in. How are you feeling?
I feel like I ran a marathon in the dead of summer barefeet...Point is I love running but it can be tiresome...keep it coming...

#How has your relationship to your peers matched or contrasted with your expectations? 
I think my relationship with my peers is good because we understand this is a demanding program. Definitely moving much faster than I thought, but having this type of peer group, you tend to work together a lot more.

#Do you think that will change at all during the remaining five months?
Any changes from this point will lead to friendship because of the the time we will be speding with each other.

#Monday we’ll conduct our first individual skills evaluation. How do you think it’ll go?
This maybe when the tears start to come down...

#What will be your strengths and weaknesses?
Team player would be my strength...when you're a beginner I want to contribute as much as I can...sometimes take the lead on a paired project just to let my teammate know we're in this together and we will get it done(talking about projects..sounded like I was promoting a blood oath).

In regards to my weakness, it's breaking concepts to the point where I'm taking small steps to completing a project. In some cases, that pace is ideal because I'm less to make mistakes, but with the speed of this program, you'lll always be facing the last minutes of deadlines(unless you're a hero...and we are NOT!)

#Make a "resolution" for the next month – what are you going to focus on doing better?
Testing...I realize, for me, it helped me on how to prepare and approach projects...


#TRAFFIC SPY

#Is working in a web context more exciting than our command-line applications?
Yes, it allows me to see what I'm building...makes the late nights with this small laptop worth it(pause moment)

#What’s more challenging/confusing?
This is not a challenge yet, but the testing process will seem confusing...


#Is testing getting easier as you gain practice, or harder as the projects get more complex?
Definitely, getting easier because its comes with repititions...and I like RSPEC!
