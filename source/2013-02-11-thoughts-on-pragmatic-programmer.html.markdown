#What lessons from the book can you apply to your work in our program?

The most important take away from the book was creating a road map for myself. With the pace of this program, you can quickly loose your way and get overwhelmed. The book taught me to take a step back to gain a better perspective on what direction I need to go when tackling the next project. My previous approach was not working. Reevaluating the approach I took with the previous projects will allow me to focus on future tasks for upcoming projects with greater precision. And now I know, eat, sleep, and (insert bad word here) coding all in moderation, will lead to better outcomes.

#Whatâ€™s the over-arching message of The Passionate Programmer?

I think the main message from the book were two key points. One, to be prepared at all times so you can two, seize any opportunity should it arise. By being prepared you are in a way creating your own opportunities. Through his personal insights and experiences I got a better understanding of how to better navigate the programming world.
