#SalesEngine

What’s something that’s still confusing to you? Why?
Still typing out the right code for our projects. Having so many methods and flexibilty in typing codes still have me thinking too much on which one would be best for this particular situation. I do feel a lot more confident in reading codes than I did 3 weeks ago.

How do you feel about testing with MiniTest? What about it makes your process harder? Easier? 
I like MiniTest is easier because it has helped me understand my coding better. The error messages give you a clear description of where to locate issues in your codes. Also, having the ability to 'skip' errors has helped me focus on one error at a time.

Is working in a pair harder or easier than being by yourself? 
A mixture of both. It was difficult at first to work in a pair because I found I wanted to see how much my partner would contribute to the project, but after we planned out our approach, I think we started to work well with each other and found it better to bounce ideas of of each other. 

Do you feel like you’d be farther ahead or behind if you were on your own? 
I believe I would have been behind. With a partner, its been beneficial and I think it allowed me to work more efficiently which has allowed for us to move through this project at a reasonable pace.

Can nine women make a baby in one month?
Depends on what you mean "make a baby"

#Becoming a Developer

It’s been a long three weeks. Do you feel like a developer yet?
As much as I feel like a Pro ball player....both are still within reach with hard work...

You have 21 weeks to go. What are you most excited about?
I will become a very good developer before playing for the Knicks...

How has the class environment matched or differed from your expectations?
The wide range of individual level of skills as developers was larger than I thought. I like the fact I can lean over to the person seating next to me on day 2 of gshcool to see if they understood what the instructor was talking about and their response: "Yeah! Why, you didn't..." That's when I knew I had a long road ahead of me....(6 months of crawling before walking)

What resources are you relying on when you need support, and why?
I am very fortunate to have instructors that are approachable when I have a questions. But, I think the best response I got from one of the instructors was: "did you look it up on Google, first"...interesting...that's what I just told my 12 year old niece to do a week ago...point...sometimes the answer is right in front of you!
